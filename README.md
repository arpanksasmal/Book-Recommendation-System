# Book Recommendation System

"In this repository, you'll find my end-to-end project focused on building a Book Recommendation System. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, and deployment using Streamlit. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and use the project for your own analysis and learning purposes."

## About The Project

The Book Recommendation System project aims to recommend books to users based on their preferences and the features of the books. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and dimensionality reduction techniques, this system utilizes TF-IDF Vectorization and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to provide personalized book recommendations.

## About the Data

The dataset `books_new.csv` includes information about books with the following columns:

- `Title`: The title of the book
- `Author`: The author of the book
- `Genre`: The genre of the book
- `SubGenre`: The subgenre of the book
- `Height`: The height of the book (numerical feature)
- `Publisher`: The publisher of the book

### Target Variable:
- The recommendation system does not use a target variable but instead relies on feature similarity for recommendations.
